# Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes network traffic data to detect potential web attacks using machine learning models.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and prepares the dataset for model training.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explores the dataset structure and relationships between features.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trains and evaluates three models:
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest
     - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
4. **Visualization**:
   - Compares the performance of the models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-intrusion-detection.git
   cd network-intrusion-detection
