# Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect network intrusions using machine learning models. It utilizes the **Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks dataset**, and trains three models to classify network traffic:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

The goal is to compare the performance of these models based on their precision, recall, and F1-scores.

## Workflow
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Cleans the dataset, removes unnecessary columns, and handles missing values.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzes the dataset to understand class distribution and feature relationships.
- Generates visualizations like class distribution plots and correlation heatmaps.

### **3. Model Training and Evaluation**
- Trains three machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, and MLP).
- Evaluates each model using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Saves the results as Excel files.

### **4. Visualization**
- Compares model performance using a grouped bar chart of precision, recall, and F1-scores.
